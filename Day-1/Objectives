# Day 1: Simple Web App Deployment on EC2

**Goal:** To deploy a basic static website using an EC2 instance, using user data to configure the server.

**Solution:** I launched an EC2 instance and used the User Data feature to automatically install the Apache web server and deploy a basic static website. This was done during the instance creation process, avoiding the need to manually configure the server after launch.

**AWS Services Used:** `EC2`, `User Data`, `Security Groups`

**Key Learnings:** I learned how to use user data to automate instance configuration. I also learned how to deploy a basic web application using EC2.

**Challenges and Solutions:** There were no particular challenges with this project.
