# Day 14: Advanced Networking with VPC Peering/Transit Gateway

**Goal:** To configure VPC peering or a Transit Gateway to connect different VPCs or on-premises networks.

**Solution:** I created a VPC peering connection between two different VPCs and configured the route tables to allow the traffic to flow between them.

**AWS Services Used:** VPC, Peering Connections, Route Tables

**Key Learnings:** I learned how to configure VPC peering connections, how to update route tables for the traffic to flow, and how to ping instances in different VPCs.

**Challenges and Solutions:** There were no particular challenges with this project.
