# Day 12: Data Analytics & Processing with S3 and Athena

**Goal:** To upload a dataset to S3 and use Athena to run queries on it.

**Solution:** I created an S3 bucket to store the data and configured an Athena table over the data in order to query it with SQL.

**AWS Services Used:** `S3`, `Athena`

**Key Learnings:** I learned how to store data in S3, and how to query the data using a serverless query engine like Athena.

**Challenges and Solutions:** There were no particular challenges with this project.
