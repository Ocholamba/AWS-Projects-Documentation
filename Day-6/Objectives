# Day 6: IAM Roles & Policies for Secure Access

**Goal:** To create custom IAM roles and policies to grant specific permissions to different services, following the principle of least privilege.

**AWS Services Used:** IAM Roles, IAM Policies

**Key Learnings:** I learned how to create IAM roles and policies following the principle of least privilege, and I also realized the importance of setting resource-based policies.

**Challenges and Solutions:** There were no particular challenges with this project.
