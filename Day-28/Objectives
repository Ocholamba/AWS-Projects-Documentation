# Day 28: Machine Learning with SageMaker (Basic)

**Goal:** To train a simple ML model using SageMaker Studio, and then use SageMaker hosting to provide a prediction endpoint.

**Solution:** I created a Machine Learning model using scikit-learn in a SageMaker Studio notebook, and then I saved it to S3. Then I tried to create a SageMaker endpoint to expose the model using a Docker image but there were issues with the definition.

**AWS Services Used:** SageMaker Studio, SageMaker Hosting, S3

**Key Learnings:** I learned how to use SageMaker Studio to train a model, and how to configure and save a Machine Learning model using Python and scikit-learn.

**Challenges and Solutions:**

I had issues with the botocore version and with how the library is used, and I was getting a TypeError: 'bytes' object is not callable error, which I was not able to fix completely.

I also had problems with the SageMaker model definition, as it requires the image to be a single architecture, and I was not able to solve this issue.
