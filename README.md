# 30-Day AWS Solutions Architect Project Challenge

This repository contains the documentation and code for my 30-day AWS Solutions Architect project challenge. I've completed a project each day, exploring different aspects of AWS and showcasing various skills required for a Solutions Architect role.

## Overview

This challenge helped me to enhance my understanding of AWS core services, as well as more advanced topics such as machine learning, media processing, and security.
