# Day 18: Content Delivery with CloudFront and WAF

**Goal:** To secure your CloudFront distribution by implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with common rule sets.

**Solution:** I created a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and associated it with my CloudFront distribution using common rules for SQL injection and other common attacks.

**AWS Services Used:** `CloudFront`, `WAF`

**Key Learnings:** I learned how to configure WAF to protect my application, and how to apply it to a CloudFront distribution. I now understand the importance of using a Web Application Firewall to protect from attacks in a production environment.

**Challenges and Solutions:** There were no particular challenges with this project.
