# Day 21: IoT Solution

**Goal:** To simulate a simple IoT device sending data to AWS IoT Core and triggering a Lambda function.

**Solution:** I created an IoT thing in AWS, configured a policy and a role for it, and then created an IoT rule that triggers a Lambda function to process the data sent by a simulated device.

**AWS Services Used:** AWS IoT Core, Lambda

**Key Learnings:** I learned how to create an IoT device and how to receive messages in a serverless function using AWS IoT Core.

**Challenges and Solutions:** There were no particular challenges with this project.
